    <h3>Hallelujah</h3>
Now I've heard there was a secret chord<br>
That David played, and it pleased the Lord<br>
But you don't really care for music, do you?<br>
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth<br>
The minor fall, the major lift<br>
The baffled King composing Hallelujah<br>
<br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
<br>
You say I took the name in vain<br>
I don't even know the name<br>
But if I did, well, really, what's it to you?<br>
There's a blaze of light in every word<br>
It doesn't matter which you heard<br>
The holy or the broken Hallelujah<br>
